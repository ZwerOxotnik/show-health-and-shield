## Overview

Custom your UI. For example: new UI, displaying parameters of players and vehicles, adding many custom settings.

(Btw, temporarily shows vehicles parameters when a player get out his vehicle and when player's cursor hover over the vehicle)

I'll add integrations with magic mods later + new nice looking icons to UI in the next updates.

Almost 0 impact on UPS!

You can find more stuff and chat on my Discord server in any case ( https://discordapp.com/invite/YyJVUCa ) ;)
