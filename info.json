For example: new UI, displaying parameters of players and vehicles, adding many custom settings.\n\n(Btw, temporarily shows vehicles parameters when a player get out his vehicle and when player's cursor hover over the vehicle)\n\nI'll add integrations with magic mods later + new nice looking icons to UI in the next updates.\n\nAlmost 0 impact on UPS!\n\nYou can find more stuff and chat on my Discord server in any case ( https://discordapp.com/invite/YyJVUCa )",
